# latent-factor-model-recommender-system
In this project, I have implemented one of the Collaborative Filtering Algorithm (Latent Factor Model) on anonymous ratings from users for 100 online jokes. The dataset is adopted from [[1]](#1).

The Recommender System factorizes user preferences and joke features into 2 Latent Factors to build latent vectors and consequently uses them to make predictions for unrated jokes.
